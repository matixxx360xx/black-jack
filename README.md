# ♠️ Black Jack (Game 21) ♣️ – HI-FI CASINO STYLE

## 🌟 About the Project
This is a complete implementation of the popular card game **Black Jack** (21), built using **pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS**. The project features not only robust casino game logic but also an **aggressive and modern aesthetic** with neon effects and animations to create a dynamic casino atmosphere.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **JavaScript (ES6):** Core game logic (the `TaliaKart` class).
* **HTML5:** User Interface structure.
* **CSS3:** Advanced animations (`@keyframes`), **3D** effects for cards, and **neon glows** for result messages.

***

## 🃏 Key Features
The game adheres strictly to casino-standard Black Jack rules:

1.  **Smart Ace Handling:** Ace values (`A`) automatically toggle between **11 and 1** to prevent the player from going Bust (exceeding 21).
2.  **Dealer Logic:** The dealer automatically draws cards until their total reaches **17** or more (`Stand on 17`).
3.  **Dynamic Turn Control:** Functional **"Karta"** (Hit) and **"Pasuj"** (Stand) buttons, with correct reveal of the Dealer's hidden card upon standing.
4.  **Deck Management:** Deck generation, shuffling, and card drawing functions are encapsulated within the `TaliaKart` class.

## ✨ Aesthetics and WOW Factor (CSS)
The visual aspect was prioritized to deliver a *hi-fi* interface:

* **Animated Casino Felt:** The background features deep green animated felt, simulating the movement and atmosphere of a gaming table.
* **3D Cards:** Cards utilize shadows and slight rotations, creating a spatial, 3D illusion.
* **Neon Result:** The final message ("Wygrana" / "Przegrana" - Win/Lose) is displayed with a **dramatic entrance animation** and an intense neon glow effect.
* **Card Back:** The Dealer's second card is concealed with a stylized card back until the player's turn is over.
